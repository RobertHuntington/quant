    the transformation on a separate thread.

    TODO: Allow transformations that change the iterable on the same thread. This makes the library
    less mistake-proof, since `feed.map(foo)` might have unexpected behavior if `feed.map_in_place`
    (for example) is called later on.

    Args:
        iterable: An iterable to initialize the feed from.
